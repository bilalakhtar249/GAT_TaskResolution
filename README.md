Based on Asp.Net MVC, WebAPI, AngularJS and SQL Server.

## Features

- Utilizes Automapper for easier conversion
- Integrated Log4Net for easier logging
- Supports Dependency Injection using Unity
- Hosts server side funtionality as a separate API
- UI is bsaed on AngularJS for better user experience

## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of  projects to work properly:

- [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [Asp.net] - awesome server side technology
- [Microsoft SQL Server] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
- [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
- [jQuery] - In conjunction with Bootstrap to make full use of responsive design
- 
## Trade-offs
- Used CSS instead of LESS.
- Used EF content directly instead of Repository.
- Did not use popup forms/components for CRUD operations.
- Omitted authentication entirely
- Mainly Desktop screens are covered for responsive design.
